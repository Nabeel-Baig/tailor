                  <h6>What is Seersucker？</h6>
                  <p>The word came into English from Persian, and originates from the words sheerand shakar, which means milk and sugar. probably from the resemblance of its smooth and rough stripes to the smooth texture of milk and the bumpy texture of sugar. Seersucker is quiet special, it’s made of light muslin with small bubbles all around it. And because of this wrinkled appearance, seersucker is ironing-free and cool to wear. It went popular since the 1930s and it was adored by American undergraduates so much that these suits became one of the classic items of Ivy style, and now they’re the mainstream of summer suits. </p>
